# Storyline Builder

A structured approach to building presentation storylines where each line becomes one slide title, creating a logical narrative flow.

## What is a Storyline?

A storyline is the backbone of a presentation - a sequence of messages that tells a complete story. Each line in the storyline becomes one slide title in the final deck.

**Key characteristics:**
- Each line = one slide title (action-oriented message)
- Logical flow from problem → context → analysis → solution
- Slide titles are the message, not topics
- Reader should understand the story from titles alone

## Core Principles

**Action Titles**
- Titles state the finding, not the topic
- Good: "Market grew 40% while revenue declined 5%"
- Bad: "Market Analysis"

**Logical Progression**
- Paint the problem or opportunity
- Provide context (market, competitive landscape)
- Show data to prove/disprove hypotheses
- Present solution and next steps

**Story Flow**
- Problem → Context → Analysis → Solution → Roadmap
- Each slide builds on the previous
- Clear beginning, middle, end

## Storyline Templates by Situation

### 1. Market Strategy / Pitch Deck

**Flow: Market opportunity → Competitive position → Product strategy → Go-forward plan**
```
Storyline:
1. [Market name] represents $XXB opportunity growing at XX% CAGR
2. We operate in [specific segment] worth $XXB with XX% growth
3. Top 3 competitors generate $XXM-XXB revenue growing XX-XX% annually
4. Our revenue of $XXM positions us as [rank/position] with XX% growth
5. [Product name] addresses [use case] for [target customer segment]
6. Top 10 customers span [industries/sectors], XX% enterprise vs XX% SMB split
7. Pricing structured as [model type] with $XX average contract value
8. Product differentiation built on [technology/approach] vs competitors
9. Key competitive advantages: [advantage 1], [advantage 2], [advantage 3]
10. Three growth opportunities identified: [opp 1], [opp 2], [opp 3]
11. Focus on [priority opportunity] based on market size and competitive position
12. 18-month roadmap prioritizes [capability 1], [capability 2], [capability 3]
```

### 2. Internal Problem-Solving (Issue Tree Format)

**Flow: Problem framing → Root cause analysis → Solution options → Prioritization → Next steps**
```
Storyline:
1. [Problem statement] - current state at XX vs target of XX
2. Problem driven by three factors: [factor 1], [factor 2], [factor 3]
3. [Factor 1] contributes $XXM impact (XX% of total problem)
4. [Factor 2] contributes $XXM impact (XX% of total problem)
5. [Factor 3] contributes $XXM impact (XX% of total problem)
6. Root cause analysis reveals [key insight from data]
7. Three solution approaches identified to address root causes
8. Solution 1: [approach] - XX% impact, $XXM investment, XX weeks
9. Solution 2: [approach] - XX% impact, $XXM investment, XX weeks
10. Solution 3: [approach] - XX% impact, $XXM investment, XX weeks
11. Prioritize [solution X] based on impact/effort analysis
12. Implementation roadmap: [Phase 1 by date], [Phase 2 by date], [Phase 3 by date]
13. Success metrics: [metric 1], [metric 2], [metric 3] tracked [frequency]
```

### 3. Project Roadmap / Implementation Plan

**Flow: Approach → Phases → Activities → Timeline → Success criteria**
```
Storyline:
1. Project objective: [goal statement with measurable outcome]
2. Four-phase approach over XX weeks: Discovery → Design → Build → Launch
3. Project roadmap spans XX weeks with clear owners and milestones:
   - Phase 1 (Weeks 1-X): User research - XX interviews across [segments] | Owner: [role]
   - Phase 2 (Weeks X-X): Solution design - Define stories, sprint planning | Owner: [role]
   - Phase 3 (Weeks X-X): MVP build - [features] across XX sprints | Owner: [role]
   - Phase 4 (Weeks X-X): Launch - Onboard XX customers | Owner: [role]
4. Core team of XX across [# domains]: PM, Design, Engineering, [other] - Gap: Need [X more roles] and $XXK investment
5. Success criteria: [metric 1] = XX, [metric 2] = XX by [date]
6. ROI measurement: Track [business metric] over XX months
```

## How to Build a Storyline

**Step 1: Identify the situation type**
- Market/strategy deck?
- Problem-solving presentation?
- Project roadmap?
- Choose appropriate template

**Step 2: Customize the flow**
- Replace placeholders with specific content
- Add or remove slides based on story needs
- Maintain logical progression

**Step 3: Write action titles**
- Each line should be a complete message
- Include data points and specifics
- Test: Can someone understand your story from titles alone?

**Step 4: Verify flow**
- Does it progress logically?
- Are there gaps in the logic?
- Does it lead to clear next steps?

**Step 5: Build slides**
- Each storyline becomes one slide
- Slide title = storyline
- Slide body supports the title message

## Common Storyline Patterns

**Problem-to-Solution Arc**
```
Problem statement → Problem sizing → Root causes → 
Solution options → Recommendation → Implementation plan
```

**Market-to-Strategy Arc**
```
Market opportunity → Competitive landscape → Our position → 
Product strategy → Roadmap → Expected outcomes
```

**Analysis-to-Action Arc**
```
Key question → Hypotheses → Data analysis → 
Insights → Recommendations → Next steps
```

## Usage Guidelines

**When creating storyline:**
- Start with the end in mind (what decision/action needed?)
- Use MECE principles to organize sections
- Include quantitative support where possible
- Make the "so what" clear at each step

**When reviewing storyline:**
- Can you understand the full story from titles alone?
- Is the logical flow clear?
- Are titles action-oriented (not topics)?
- Does it lead to clear conclusion/next steps?
- Are data points specific (not vague)?

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Topic titles**: "Market Analysis" instead of "Market growing 40% CAGR"
- **Missing the "so what"**: Data without interpretation
- **Illogical jumps**: Skipping steps in reasoning
- **Too granular**: 50 slides when 15 would tell the story
- **No ending**: Storyline trails off without clear next steps
- **Vague language**: "Good performance" instead of "Revenue grew 25%"

## Tips for Effective Storylines

**Start with structure**
- Outline major sections first
- Fill in detailed slides within each section
- Typical deck: 15-25 slides for exec presentation

**Consider executive summary upfront**
- Optional first slide summarizing key message
- Useful for: Problem statement, recommendation, expected impact
- Allows execs to get punchline immediately
- Rest of deck provides supporting detail

**Use parallel structure**
- Keep similar sections in similar format
- Makes story easier to follow
- Example: If slide 5 is "Factor 1: $XXM impact", slide 6 should be "Factor 2: $XXM impact"

**Include signposts**
- Use section breaks or agenda slides
- Help audience know where they are in story
- Example: "Three drivers of the problem" followed by three slides

**Build to the punchline**
- Lead audience through your thinking
- Don't jump to recommendations without proof
- But don't bury the lede - executive summary upfront often works

**Iterate**
- First draft won't be perfect
- Review logical flow
- Get feedback before building full slides
- Much easier to reorganize storyline than finished slides
